The project was conceived as a place to collect tools useful in the development process. There is currently a tool called **[ttools/build](https://github.com/TuleshDev/ttools/tree/main/build)** that allows you to build a project by copying from different sources. Its description is contained in the [ttools/build/README.md](https://github.com/TuleshDev/ttools/blob/main/build/README.md) file.
